# SBA - Frontend Mentor Project: Digital Bank Landing Page

## Overview

This project is a responsive landing page for a fictional digital bank, built using Bootstrap 5. It is a solution to the Frontend Mentor challenge: Digital Bank Landing Page.

The goal of this challenge is to create a visually appealing, mobile-first design that 
works across multiple screen sizes, following a Figma design provided by Frontend Mentor.

The project showcases modern HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap layout techniques, including Flexbox and the Bootstrap grid system.


## Description

The landing page includes:

A responsive navbar with collapsible menu on mobile
A hero section with promotional content and call-to-action buttons
Feature cards highlighting the bank’s services
A latest articles section with card components
A footer with social media icons and additional links

Customizations made:

Created custom button styles to match the Figma design instead of using the default Bootstrap button.

Adjusted content order for mobile vs desktop using Bootstrap’s responsive ordering (order-1, order-2, etc.) to ensure the layout looks natural on all screen sizes.

Applied a custom color palette and typography (Kumbh Sans) to match the design system.
Added linear gradient buttons and a dark footer background for contrast.

# REFLECTION QUESTIONS

During this project, I encountered several challenges while translating the Figma design into a responsive Bootstrap layout. Customizing Bootstrap buttons was one of the main hurdles, as the default styles did not match the design. I resolved this by creating a custom gradient button with rounded edges and fixed dimensions.

Another challenge was responsive content stacking—some sections needed a different order on mobile versus desktop. I addressed this using Bootstrap’s responsive order classes and testing across breakpoints. Additionally, ensuring consistent typography and spacing required careful attention to font sizes, line heights, and spacing to closely match the design.

If given more time, I would focus on refining the custom CSS styles further to reduce the default Bootstrap “look” and make the page feel entirely unique. Overall, the project strengthened my skills in responsive design, Bootstrap customization, and translating a static design into a functional, mobile-first webpage.
